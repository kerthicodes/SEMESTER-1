<h2> REFLECTION </h2>
<div align="justify">
<p>On 29th October 2025, students of the computing faculty were assigned to attend UTM Digital’s Open Day. UTM Digital is an organization within Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) that develops and implements new applications and upgrades existing ones, covering the core business of the University. This visit is important because I can explore new things related to my study course.</p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this open day, I attended a talk  by Mr. Helmi bin Yaacob, senior IT Officer, Department of IT Services. I gained some additional knowledge about system development. For example, reasons for project failure, Agile methodology, and some tips for application development. Agile methodology is a project management approach that breaks work into small and flexible. Poor preparation, bad leadership, and bad stakeholders can lead to the failure of a project. A new insight I learned from this talk was that UTM Digital saves all UTM students’ databases using Oracle Database.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, I also got a chance to interview one of the UTM Digital staff named Muhammad Farid bin Mohd Ariffin, Assistant Information Technology Officer. He explained a few systems that were created by the UTM Digital staff themselves to help students. This made me feel fortunate to have a great technology development at the university I'm studying, because I can improve my programming and system analysis skills.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For future improvements, I hope the people in charge of this event can add more booths to visit in the future. Other than that, I also hope that they can conduct this event for more than two days, so that more students can get  to know about UTM Digital.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this visit increased my interest in system development and gave a better industry exposure.
